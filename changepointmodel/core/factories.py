"""Some factory methods for configuration and generating result pydantic schemas to and from internals.

Some of the configuration is complicated to produce the vast amount of results we require along with a model. (We used to call this the post-modeling calcs at BPL)
These are here as higher level abstractions that help keep all the library components loosely coupled but still able to work together. While we are take some 
steps to make sure the configuration between the various components are valid it is largely at this time still up to the caller to make sure they are using and 
testing a correct configuration.

These Factory objects do not make any assumptions about workflow and should be wrapped 
in even higher order functions or classes on in application (i.e. an RPC service or batch processing script).
